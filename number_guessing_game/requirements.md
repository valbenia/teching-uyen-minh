## üìã Assignment Overview

### üéØ **Objective:**
Create a complete Number Guessing Game using Python's Tkinter library. This assignment will test your understanding of GUI programming, event handling, game logic, and user experience design.

### üéÆ **Game Description:**
The computer will randomly select a number between 1 and 100. The player has 10 attempts to guess the correct number. After each guess, the game provides feedback ("Too High" or "Too Low") to help the player narrow down their next guess. The game tracks the best score (fewest attempts) and maintains a history of all guesses.

### üìö **Learning Goals:**
- Master Tkinter GUI components and layout management
- Implement event-driven programming with user input validation
- Design game state management and flow control
- Create engaging user experience with visual feedback
- Practice object-oriented programming principles
