## 🔧 Configuration

Game settings can be modified in `game_config.py`:

```python
class GameConfig:
    MIN_NUMBER = 1          # Minimum guess value
    MAX_NUMBER = 100        # Maximum guess value
    MAX_ATTEMPTS = 10       # Attempts per game
    WINDOW_WIDTH = 500      # Window dimensions
    WINDOW_HEIGHT = 650
    # Colors, fonts, and messages...
```
